# KiddoWorld Landing Page

A vibrant, kid-friendly landing page designed for children, featuring a colorful and playful theme with bright animations, a fun aesthetic, and an engaging layout. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this page is perfect for attracting young users with its cheerful design.

## Features
- **Kid-Friendly Design**: Bright colors, rounded fonts, and playful animations tailored for children.
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Dynamic Background**: Organic, colorful shapes animated with p5.js for a lively backdrop.
- **Interactive Elements**: Animated call-to-action button and hover effects on the navbar.
- **Fun Typography**: Uses Comic Neue and Baloo 2 fonts for a whimsical look.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- No server setup required as the page uses a CDN for p5.js and Google Fonts.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Download or Clone**: Download the `index.html` file or clone the repository.
2. **Open in Browser**: Open `index.html` directly in a web browser to view the landing page.
3. **Optional - Local Server**:
   - Use a local server like `Live Server` in VS Code or run `python -m http.server` in the project directory for development.
   - This ensures proper loading of assets and scripts.

## File Structure
```
├── index.html       # Main HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
└── README.md        # This file
```

## Dependencies
- **p5.js**: Included via CDN (`https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.4.2/p5.min.js`) for background animations.
- **Google Fonts**: Comic Neue and Baloo 2 fonts loaded via `<link>` for playful typography.

## Customization
- **Colors**: Modify the gradient in the `body` background (e.g., `#ffeb3b`, `#ff5722`) or text colors in the `.hero` section.
- **Text Content**: Update the `<h1>` and `<p>` tags in the `.hero` section to change the welcome message.
- **Animations**: Adjust the `draw()` function in the JavaScript to tweak the background shapes' size, speed, or colors.
